## 📸 React Native Camera App (Expo)

This React Native app is built using Expo and demonstrates how to integrate camera functionality using the `expo-camera` library. The app allows users to:
- Request camera permission.
- Toggle camera visibility.
- Capture a photo using the back camera.
- Display the captured photo in the UI.

### 🚀 Features

- Expo-based camera integration
- Real-time camera preview using `CameraView`
- Photo capturing with `takePictureAsync()`
- Image display using the captured URI
- State management with React Hooks (`useState`, `useRef`)
- Clean UI using `react-native-paper` components

### 📦 Libraries Used

- [expo-camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/)
- [react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)
- [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)

### 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
npm install

 
 
3. Start the Expo app:
npx expo start

  
4. Run the app on your physical device or emulator (camera functionality works best on a real device).
